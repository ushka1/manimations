Animations can be previewed on <https://ushka1.github.io/manimations>.

Alternatively all finished and rendered animations are available in the [`renders/`](./renders/) directory.

## Covered Topics

- Stirling numbers of the first kind
- Stirling numbers of the second kind
- Forbidden configurations
- Rook polynomials 1 - definition & example
- Rook polynomials 2 - row/column swaps <!-- + transposition -->
- Rook polynomials 3 - disjoint boards
- Rook polynomials 4 - row-column removal
<!-- - Rook polynomials 5 - highest factor calculated by usage of complement board -->

## Rendering

1. First install the following dependencies:
    - `Manim`
    - `TeXLive` (with support for Polish language)
1. Then run the `render.sh` script to render the animations. Rendered animations will be saved in the `media/videos/` directory.
